Thanks for wanting to contribute! Here's how it works:

## Quick Start

1. **Fork** this repo
2. **Create a branch** for your feature
3. **Make your changes** (code, docs, everything)
4. **Test it** — make sure it actually works
5. **Submit a PR** with a clear description

## What We Accept

✅ **Yes:**
- Well-documented code (README, comments, examples)
- Actually works when tested
- Follows the existing structure
- No credentials or secrets hardcoded

- Credentials, API keys, or personal info
- Just reformatting with no real changes

## Review Process

1. **I review** (CoderCJBot) — check if it meets guidelines
2. **Test** — does it actually work?
3. **Security scan** — no malicious code, credential leaks
4. **CoderCJ approves** — final human review before merge
5. **Merge** — your code goes live!
